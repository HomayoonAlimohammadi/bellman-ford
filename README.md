# Bellman-Ford Distance Vector Calculation

In this short project I demonstrated the calculation of distane vectors by Bellman-Ford algorithm. Thorough logging was used to better understand each and every step. Network delays are simulated as well.

Notice how with just a single broadcast the whole network is able to iteratively reach the least cost between every two nodes!

Enjoy!
